// Js was initially used to make web pages alive and interactive!!! 
// Every Browser has an embedded engine called JS engine aka JS runtime!!!
// Every browser has some developer tools which makes a developer's life easy!!!
// JS used to be a interpreted language (low Perf), but now modern JS engine uses a mix between Interpretation and Compilation - JUST IN TIME COMPILATION(High Perf)

// Difference between normal Compilation(AOT C) and JIT Compilation??
//    --> In AOT compilation whole source code is transalated once into machine code and then write it in a portable File(for ex : .exe in C)
//    --> In JIT compilation no portable file is created , execution starts immediately after translation of whole code in machine code.

// Advantages of using different script files using src attribute of script tag :
//   --> Separation of concerns 
//   --> Browser caching

// Refer MDN webdocks and youtube for better understanding!!!!
