            <h2>American Bandogge</h2> 
            <p>The Bandogge is an extremely intelligent dog. It is confident and very docile. Like all Mastiffs, they should have owners who are capable of staying dominant over the dogs. They are not usually recommended as good choices for first-time dog owners, because they need someone who truly understands canine instinct and how to properly communicate what it is you want from him.The American Bandogge is a breed that loves attention and thrives on leadership. If you are not this dog’s 100% pack leader and/or if you do not provide enough mental and physical exercise it will become very upset when left alone and will be hard to control.</p>
